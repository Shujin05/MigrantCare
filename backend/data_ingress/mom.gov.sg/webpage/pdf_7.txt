insights to help with your 
workforce planning and hiring.

score on these firm-related

 when the candidate’s nationality  
 forms a small share of the firm’s  
 PMET employees. 
• No points are earned if the
 candidate's nationality currently  
 forms a significant share of its   
 PMET employees.
