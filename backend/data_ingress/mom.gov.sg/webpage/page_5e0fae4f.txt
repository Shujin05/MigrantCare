A contract of service defines the employer-employee relationship, including
the terms and conditions of employment. The contract must include key
employment terms (KETs) and essential clauses, such as hours of work and job
scope.

A contract of service is an agreement in which:

  * One person agrees to employ another as an employee
  * The other person agrees to serve the employer as an employee

The agreement can be in writing, verbal, expressed or implied. It can be in
the form of a letter of appointment or employment, or an apprenticeship
agreement. However, to minimise disputes on the agreed terms and conditions,
the contract should be in writing.

## Key employment terms

### Requirements

Employers must issue KETs in writing to all employees who meet all the
following requirements:

  * Enter into a contract of service on or after 1 April 2016.
  * Are covered by the Employment Act.
  * Are employed for 14 days or more. This refers to the length of contract, not the number of days of work.

What to include |  Find out the [items that must be included in your KETs](/employment-practices/contract-of-service/key-employment-terms). Use [KETs verification tool](/employment-practices/contract-of-service/kets-verification-tool) to generate sections on work arrangements and salary.  
---|---  
When |  Within **14 days** after the start of employment. If your employee starts work on 1 January, you must issue the KETs by 15 January.  
Format | 

  * Soft or hard copy, including handwritten.
  * Common KETs, e.g. leave policy, medical benefits, can be provided in employee handbook or company intranet.

  
  
## Starting a contract of service

The contract is in effect when the new recruit turns up for work on the
appointed starting date.

If the recruit fails to turn up:

  * The Employment Claims Act does not apply, as the employee has not started work.
  * The employer cannot claim notice pay or any compensation under the Employment Claims Act.
  * Any claims for compensation by the employer will have to be made as a civil claim in Court.

## Confirmation of an employee

Confirmation depends on the terms in the contract, as it is not covered by the
Employment Act.

**Note:** The length of an employee's service is calculated from the date on
which the employee starts work, and not the date of confirmation.

## Terminating a contract of service

Either the employer or the employee can [terminate a contract of
service](/employment-practices/termination-of-employment).

## Contract of service vs. contract for service

A **contract of service** is an agreement between an employer and an employee.

In a **contract for service** , an independent contractor, such as a self-
employed person or vendor, is engaged for a fee to carry out an assignment or
project.

This table summarises the main differences between the two:

Contract of service  |  Contract for service   
---|---  
Has an employer-employee relationship  |  Has a client-contractor type of relationship   
Employee does business for the employer  |  Contractor carries out business on their own account   
May be covered by the Employment Act (Find out [who is covered](/employment-practices/employment-act/who-is-covered))  |  Not covered by the Employment Act   
Includes terms of employment such as working hours, leave benefits, etc.  |  Statutory benefits do not apply   
  
There is, however, no single conclusive test to distinguish a contract of
employment from a contract for services.

Some of the factors to be considered in identifying a contract of employment
include:

  * Control  

    * Who decides on the recruitment and dismissal of employees?
    * Who pays for employees' wages and in what ways?
    * Who determines the production process, timing and method of production?
    * Who is responsible for the provision of work?
  * Ownership of factors of production  

    * Who provides the tools and equipment?
    * Who provides the working place and materials?
  * Economic considerations 
    * Is the business carried out on the person's own account or is it for the employer?
    * Can the person share in profit or be liable to any risk of loss?
    * How are earnings calculated and profits derived?

## Key terms of engagement template for self-employed persons

Self-employed persons (SEPs) can use the [KETs template for
SEPs](/-/media/mom/documents/employment-practices/kets/template-key-terms-of-
engagement-seps.docx) to request your service-buyers to provide key terms of
engagement.

Service-buyers can use the template as a guide.

As a service-buyer, if you include all suggested terms in **Sections A â€“ E** ,
you are ready to adopt the [Tripartite Standard on Contracting with
SEPs](http://www.tafep.sg/contracting-self-employed-persons). You are
encouraged to do so.

We also encourage SEPs to get your service-buyers to adopt the Tripartite
Standard on Contracting with SEPs.

You can change the template to suit your needs.
